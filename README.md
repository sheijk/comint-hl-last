# comint-hl-last

A minor mode to highlight the output of the last command in Emacs shell buffers.

![Before ls](before.png)
![After ls](after.png)

After running the second ls command it's output will get highlighted by a
vertical bar on the left side so it's easy to spot where the output of the last
command started. For long running commands the bar will get updated on-the-fly.
